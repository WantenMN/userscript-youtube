# YouTube Full Screen Enhancer

This script enhances the user experience when pausing a YouTube video in full-screen mode by hiding certain elements and adding a play icon.

## Features

- **Hide Video Title**: The video title is hidden when the video is paused in full-screen mode.
- **Hide Player Control Bar**: The player control bar is hidden when the video is paused in full-screen mode.

- **Stabilize Captions**: Prevents captions text from jumping up and down when you pause or resume the video using the spacebar or "K" key.

- **Add Play Icon**: A play icon is added at the bottom right corner of the video when paused.

## Screenshot
