When you press the "e" key, you can toggle the following features, which apply when you pause a YouTube video in full screen mode by pressing the spacebar or K key:

- Hiding the video title
- Hiding the player control bar
- Hiding annotations
- Preventing captions text from jumping up and down when you pause or resume the video using the spacebar or K key.

In the code, you have the ability to modify the shortcut key that toggles the script. Additionally, you can also adjust the values of both hideProgressBar and isMouseMoveToggle within the code.
